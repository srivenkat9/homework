        Lab is about controlling blinking of a led using switch
	we installed fritzing to create wiring diagrams
	we Read the switches and flash the LEDs from the command line
          
          file input2.js consists of code for blinking 2 leds when switch is pressed
          file input3.js consists of code for blinking an led 10 times when a switch is pressed
          file input4.js consists of code for blinking an led when a switch is pressed and fading when another switch is pressed
